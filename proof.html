Sorry, (link-reveal: "who is this?")[

(link-reveal: "//Just a friend reaching out. I heard the news that you’re sick. I’m so sorry, that fucking sucks//.")[

Thanks, but it’s really not a big deal. I don’t think, it’s like, that serious. I’ll probably be out of hospital like next week. (link-reveal: "At least I don’t have to do my algebra test anymore haha!")[

(link-reveal: "//That’s really great that you’ve got a positive attitude - you’re definitely going to need that! But I do think it’s going to be a lot longer than that. And I think it is a big deal. It’s great if you can have a laugh about it, but that doesn’t undermine that what you’ve got is quite serious.//")[

Um, (link-reveal: "how would you know?")[

(link-reveal: "//A.L.L is a really aggressive type of cancer. It’s much more common in younger people, but the survival rate is very high. It’s a weird thing to say, but if you’re going to get cancer, this is the one you want to get.//")[

Oh my god survival rate, that’s so dramatic haha what do you mean? I’m not gonna die or anything. And like I’m not gonna lose my hair or that shit. It’s fine, the doctors are gonna do some chemo and get rid of it (link-reveal: "and then everything will be back to normal.")[

(link-reveal: "//I never said you were going to die (you will eventually, hopefully when you’re 100 years old and in your rocker). But you will probably lose your hair. And some other things too. As terrifying as that sounds, it’s not the worst thing in the world. Hair does grow back! Also, that would be awesome if it really was just the one time they give you chemo, but unfortunately it’s not.//")[

What are you on about? (link-reveal: "You're scaring me lol.")[

(link-reveal: "//Even if they kill the cancer with the first round of chemo, they’ll have to do several more rounds over a couple of years, so it doesn’t come back. That’s how aggressive it is. Kind of like having laser treatment. You gotta do it more than once. Didn’t the doctor explain this to you?//")[

Um, I don’t know.. I can’t really remember. I think I zoned out after he said cancer. Shit. Fuck. I can’t do this. What am I gonna do? (link-reveal: "Fuck, I'm gonna die right?")[

(link-reveal: "//Okay, let’s just calm down. As I said, there’s a very high success rate in treatment. You’re going to have to take it day by day. You’re lucky you’ve got an amazing support network around you, and the best medical team looking after you.//")[ 

Is it reall as bad as they say? (link-reveal: "Does it hurt?")[

(link-reveal: "//Look, I’m not going to lie to you. It fucking hurts, in every way possible. I would not recommend it. But you’ll be okay, in the end. You’re a trooper, I can tell. You’ve absolutely got this. And I’m going to help you along the way//.")[

How can you help? What makes you so special? (link-reveal: "Who even are you?")[

(link-reveal: "//That’s not important. But I promise I’m going to be there for you. You’ll have to go through a lot of scary things that nobody your age should have to go through, or anybody for that matter. Everything is going to change. But I’ll support you in any way I can. If you want me to, that is. I can leave though if you don’t want me around, it is totally up to you//.")[

Not great. (link-reveal: "I've felt better.")[

(link-reveal: "//Any major symptons so far?//")[

I don’t know, I just feel tired. Pretty much all the time. I have this like weird metallic taste in my mouth, but I can’t taste food. Also when I had a shower today my hair started falling out. My bones hurt too. (link-reveal: "I look like absolute shit.")[

(link-reveal: "//Yep, those are all pretty common side effects of chemo. Have you been eating much?//")[

No, between losing my taste buds and feeling nauseous, (link-reveal: "I don’t have much of an appetite.")[

(link-reveal: "//It’s important that you eat. Your body is very weak right now, so it needs all the nutrition it can get. You’ll be able to enjoy food again, but for now it is simply for sustenance.//")[

''BY ALYSSA DE LEO
''
This is a digital interactive story based on my personal experience of being diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia at fifteen-years-old in 2014, written by my twenty-five-year-old self ten years later in 2024. 

It features the good, the bad, and the ugly.

I’ve tried to include humour and lightness in this story where I can, because that is something that helped me through this journey. However, please note that this piece contains mature and upsetting themes around ''cancer'', ''death'', ''mental health'', as well as references to ''self-harm''. If you are in the right emotional headset, please read on. I would recommend avoiding this story if any of these topics are triggering for you. 

Thank you.
